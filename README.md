I work on computer vision, SLAM, tracking, and other robotics stuff.

I love imaging technologies such as lidar, cameras, and [line scan cameras](https://github.com/dllu/nectar).

You can find more information on my [website](https://daniel.lawrence.lu).

I also try to contribute photos to [Wikimedia Commons](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/User:Dllu).
